# NARA Aliens

Some code to pull data about A-files from the national archives using their API.

Kind of a mess. 'fuller_data.parquet' contains the records; the Ipython notebooks were used to create it, although I doubt they'd run without some adjustment. See https://observablehq.com/@bmschmidt/a-files for an interface.

CSV and feather files not checked in because of size.
